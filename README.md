# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project ðŸš€
Welcome to the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization! This project serves as the culmination of the entire program, bringing together the knowledge, tools, and techniques covered throughout the course into a comprehensive, hands-on data science endeavor.

# Project Overview
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## ðŸ“„ Questions to be answered
* How do variables affect the success of the first stage landing?
* Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
* What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?


## ðŸ“„ Methodology

### 1. Data collection methodology
* Using SpaceX Rest API
* Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia

### 2. Performed data wrangling
* Filtering the data
* Dealing with missing values
* Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
* Using data visualization tools to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process

### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
* Using SQL queries to select and sort data
  
### 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
* Generating interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using the Folium library.

### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
* Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best results
